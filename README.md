# Pokedex at home 

This is a small project is small project I learn along the way of my journey to pursuit the job in developer field. 

The feature is pretty simeple. It is a web that off pokemon from Gen I with name, number and typical information and you can find in the actual game at ease. I plan to hone my skill to and build more complex and resourceful pokedex in the future :D
